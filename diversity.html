        <h2>Paths to PhDs </h2>
        <h3><i>Helping diverse students learn about graduate opportunities in psychology, neuroscience, and related fields</i></h3>
        <p>Graduate school should not be just for the privileged few.  If one is interested in pursuing a research career, is intelligent, and willing to work hard, then a graduate education should be within reach.  However, far too many undergraduates -- particularly those from minority backgrounds and those who are the first in the families to go to college -- are unaware of higher education opportunities, or find it hard to see themselves attaining a graduate degree.  To address this issue in the San Diego area, I have organized the Paths to PhDs panel workshop series at UCSD for the past two years.  At each event, a panel of five or six graduate students from different areas of psychology/neuroscience research discuss and answer questions on topics such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Why did you decide to go to graduate school?</li>
          <li>Did your family support your decision to go to graduate school?</li>
          <li>Is your chosen profession in alignment with the expectations of your cultural background?</li>
          <li>Did you have research experience, and what kind of experience was that?</li>
          <li>Did you take a break between undergrad and grad school?  How did you manage finances at that time?</li>
          <li>How did you pick which programs to apply for?</li>
          <li>How did you prepare for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or other required tests?</li>
          <li>What was the interview experience like?</li>
          <li>...and many more considerations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Paths to PhDs is generously sponsored by UCSD Psychology’s Diversity Committee and <a href="http://ccc.ucsd.edu/Cross">UCSD’s  Cultural Center</a>, which itself is supported by the university’s <a href="http://diversity.ucsd.edu/">Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</a>.  Each event, which typically takes place in Price Center, is announced in the campus <a href="http://studentevents.ucsd.edu/">Student Events Insider</a>, in  diversity organization newsletters, as at nearby universities (e.g., SDSU, USD, CSUSM).</p>
        <h4>Here are some testimonials from past attendees:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>“I liked the honesty the panelists expressed about their process to get to grad school, it was reassuring to hear how not all of them went directly after college to a graduate program. It was definitely scary to hear the level of difficulty to be admitted to a graduate program and the experience needed, but it was something that it definitely worth knowing, so it was very much appreciated.” </li>
          <li>“I really appreciated the discussion about what would make our applications better or give us more experience for graduate school, both of which helped a lot.” </li>
          <li>“What I liked most about the panel was the variety of fields represented and that the panelists were very willing to answer questions honestly.” </li>
        </ul>
